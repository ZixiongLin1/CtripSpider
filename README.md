# CtripSpider

Automatically download data of hotels of interested city and save the information as a csv file.
The information includes all the basic information, room avg price, highest price, lowest price,
open and renovation time, hotel size, etc.

Since this is a one-time used spider, cookie and other authentication (eleven and twelve) was
hard-coded in. Should be treated as just a reference rather than use it directly.
